/**
 * This loop simply calls arriveAndAwaitAdvance( ) until the phaser is terminated. The phaser
 * wonâ€™t terminate until the specified number of phases have been executed. In this case, the
 * loop continues to execute until four phases have run. Next, notice that the threads also call
 * arriveAndAwaitAdvance( ) within a loop that runs until the phaser is terminated. This
 * means that they will execute until the specified number of phases has been completed.
 * Now, look closely at the code for onAdvance( ). Each time onAdvance( ) is called, it is
 * passed the current phase and the number of registered parties. If the current phase equals
 * the specified phase, or if the number of registered parties is zero, onAdvance( ) returns
 * true, thus stopping the phaser
